# Create Addon Guide

Generate a comprehensive `Guide.md` for a CAW (Construct Addon Wizard) Construct 3 addon.

## Steps

1. **Read the addon source** to understand what it does:
   - `config.caw.js` — addon ID, name, type, properties
   - `src/aces/` — all ACE files (actions, conditions, expressions, triggers)
   - `src/runtime/instance.js` — runtime logic, available methods, data model
   - Any existing `Guide.md` or `README.md` for context

2. **Write `Guide.md`** at the project root following the structure below. No section should be a stub — every section must be fleshed out with prose, tables, and code examples.

3. avoid using emdashes

## Guide.md Structure

### Title and intro paragraph
- One paragraph: what the addon does, what problem it solves, what the developer gets out of it.

### Table of Contents
- Numbered, anchored links to every `##` section.

### 1. Scenarios Where This Addon Excels
- Put this section before Core Concepts so readers see real use cases first.
- Include 4–7 bullet points, each named and bolded, describing practical, plain-language scenarios.

### 2. Core Concepts
- **The problem this addon solves** — describe the manual work the addon replaces.
- **Key design decisions** — any ownership model, sandboxing, or constraint the user must understand.
- **Key concepts at a glance** — a short table of the 3–6 most important terms/concepts.

### 3. Project Setup
Step-by-step: install, configure, wire up the first working example. Show an actual event sheet snippet.

### 4. Plugin Properties
Table: Property | Type | Default | Description. Cover every property in `config.caw.js`.

### 5–N. Feature Sections
One section per major feature group. Name them after what the user thinks about, not internal implementation names. Each section should include:
- What it does and when to use it
- How to configure or call it
- A concrete event sheet example (code block using Construct-style pseudocode — see Writing Style Rules)
- Edge cases or gotchas the user will hit

### Actions Reference
One sub-table per ACE category. Columns: Action | Description. Descriptions are concise (1–2 sentences), beginner-friendly, and say what the action *does*, not just what its parameters are.

### Conditions Reference
Single table: Condition | Description.

### Expressions Reference
Single table: Expression | Returns | Description.

### Triggers Reference (if any)
Single table: Trigger | Description.

### System Use Cases
One section per major system in the addon (e.g. Registration, World State, Evaluation, Selection, History, Save/Load). Each system section has:
- A one-line description of what the system does.
- 2–4 focused use cases that isolate that system's capabilities. Each use case has:
  - A **Scenario** sentence.
  - An **Event sheet** pseudocode block.
  - A short closing note if there's a non-obvious tip or gotcha specific to that system.

These are system-focused examples — they should be tightly scoped to the feature being illustrated, not full game setups. Cross-system interactions belong in the Game Use Cases section below.

### Game Use Cases
20 or more standalone use cases. Each has:
- **Scenario:** one sentence describing the real-world situation.
- **Layer structure** (if relevant) — a code block showing the C3 layer hierarchy.
- **Event sheet** — a code-block pseudocode snippet that a developer could translate directly into C3 events.
- A short closing note if there's a non-obvious tip.

Use cases should cover: the simplest possible setup, the most common advanced pattern, at least one edge case (cleanup, persistence, error state), and at least one combination of multiple features.

After the numbered use cases, add a `### Other game use cases` sub-section. This section contains brief paragraph-per-genre descriptions (no full event-sheet code blocks) showing how the addon fits common game genres at a high level. Bold the genre name at the start of each paragraph. write them from the feature set. Aim for 20 or more genres.

### C3 Debugger (if `_getDebuggerProperties` is implemented)
- What sections the debugger shows
- A table of every field and what it means
- How to open the debugger

### Scripting (C3 Script / JavaScript)
Include this section if the addon has any `expose: true` ACEs or any public camelCase methods on the instance. It should cover:

- **Accessing the behavior/plugin** — show `inst.behaviors.BehaviorName` (or `inst.BehaviorName` for plugins) and how the name comes from the project, not the addon ID.
- **Calling actions from script** — explain that `expose: true` copies the ACE function directly onto the prototype (not a thin wrapper), so calling it from script produces the same side-effects as the event sheet action. Method names are **PascalCase**, derived from the ACE filename (`a.RemoveBuff.js` → `RemoveBuff()`). Document parameter order. Note that combo parameters arrive as **0-based indices**.
- **Reading state from script** — document any public camelCase getter methods on the instance. These are NOT the same as expressions (expressions are not callable from script); they are methods added to the instance class. Group by category (stat values, buff info, counts, etc.) with a code block.
- **Listening to events from script** — show `inst.behaviors.X.addEventListener("OnTriggerName", callback)` for each trigger the addon fires. Event context accessors (if any) should be called from within the listener.
- **Looping patterns** — if the addon exposes Count + Index expressions, show the JS equivalent using a `for` loop.
- **A complete example** — a short class or function showing realistic usage of actions + getters + event listeners together.

### Feature Deep-Dives (one per complex feature, if needed)
For features that need more than a paragraph — like timescale control, animation system, save/load — give them their own numbered section with sub-sections, tables, and code examples.
If a feature deep-dive covers integration with other addons, include multiple examples that show different integration patterns, not just one happy-path snippet.

### Tips and Common Mistakes
A bullet list of the top 5–10 gotchas: things that look like they should work but don't, ordering requirements, naming constraints, ownership rules.

## Writing Style Rules

- **Plain English.** Avoid SDK jargon unless you define it first.
- **Every claim needs a code example.** Don't describe what an action does without showing it in an event sheet block.
- **Event sheet pseudocode format** — use this consistently:
  ```
  Event: [trigger or condition]
    Condition: [optional sub-condition]
    Action: [ActionName] -> "[param]", param2
    // comment explaining why, not what
  ```
- **Tables for reference; prose for concepts.** Use prose to explain why something works the way it does. Use tables for lookup (properties, conditions, expressions).
- **Bold the first use of every term** the reader needs to remember.
- **Section headers** use `##` for top-level, `###` for sub-sections. No `####` unless a sub-section has multiple named variants.
